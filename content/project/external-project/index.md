summary: We implemented in Python the Isotonic estimator of the paper "Efficient Isotonic Estimation in Wicksell Problem". We created a dedicated library that can be installed by any Python user willing to deploy this estimator. In the library is contained also a tester where the user can test the estimator choosing from a set of hidden distribution functions F of the radii distribution.
