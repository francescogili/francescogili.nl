summary: We implemented in Python the Isotonic estimator of the paper "Adaptive and Efficient Isotonic Estimation in Wicksell Problem". We provide the used code where the user can try the estimator choosing from a set of hidden distribution functions F of the radii distribution.

title: Python implementation of Isotonic Estimator in Wicksell Problem

The implementation of the above library is essentially based on the PAVA algorithm. Before the publication of this Python Package there was no library in Python that contained the PAVA algorithm (it was available only in R-Studio).
